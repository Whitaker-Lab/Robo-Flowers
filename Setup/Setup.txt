This project uses RapsberryPi Zero WHs running the 32-bit Bookworm Lite OS (November 2024 release). Wifi credentials and ssh are enabled during SD card formatting. Once the pis are booted and connected to wifi, they can be accessed via ssh and set up by sending and executing the NewPiSetup.sh script (Operating Code) on each pi.
